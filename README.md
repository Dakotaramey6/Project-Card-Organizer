# Project Card Organizer V1.1

## How to use

Just download the files (Script.js, index.html, Style.css and Buttons.css) and run the index.html in a browser of your choice. This is a local file that is not hosted on a web server

## Features

- Create a card button that creates a card and allows the card to move to any section using buttons that populate with the card.
- Start over by simply pressing the Startover button.
- Delete any unwanted cards by pressing the delete button that populates with that card

### Future Plans

- Local Storage - 90% completed
- Naming your Project
- Host on a web server
- IDS for the created divs

### Notes

Please note the Class in script.js would be in a different file though import and export do not function unless the files are hosted on a web server
